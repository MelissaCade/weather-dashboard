# weather-tracker

A simple weather tracking site that allows users to toggle between cities to see a 5-day forecast.

## Description

A weather dashboard that allows users to toggle between multiple cities of interest to see the current weather and a five-day forecast. This is a group project exploring the use of 3rd-party APIs as well as DOM manipulation.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

A user can enter a city, select the state, and search. Upon searching, the site calls a weather API and returns the current weather, as well as the five day forecast for that city. Any cities searched will remain on the sidebar as a button to be toggled between and refreshed with the latest weather data.
